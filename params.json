{"name":"Mess-manager","body":"# mess-manager\r\n============\r\n\r\n## What?\r\nA peer to peer distributed encrypted storage and message manager.\r\n\r\n## Why?\r\n* I trust people in groups I assign more than I trust lobbying corps.\r\n* I would like to see multi-player games go serverless, adless, community driven, and free.\r\n* Bypass Censorship, Filtering, and discriminatory business practices.\r\n\r\n## How?\r\nThe manager API provides network messaging, peer management, and file storage to Applications.  Under the hood, **sqlite** databases contain information on peers (and peers of peers) last connection addresses and protocol preferences and file and group tables.  **crypto++** provides a menu of encryption strategies.  Mess Manager follows various strategies for updating, propagating, and encrypting different kinds (Clumps) of data and messages to peers.\r\n\r\n* A **Mess** is your local storage state.\r\n* A **Clump** is a security and management group within the **Mess** following specified strategies for encryption, propagation to other peers, and update triggers.  \r\n* A **Nugget** is one of many files in a **Clump** allowing for fractional or statistical propagation of clumps\r\n\r\n\r\n## Potential implementations:\r\nSocial network app with embedded game api.\r\nMedium sized multiplayer games.\r\nDocument Collaboration\r\nMutual security apps\r\nBackup to friends\r\nDistributed simulations\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","tagline":"","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
